### Spice up your Mac

Please follow these instructions to set up your Mac.

1. Run the following command to download the .dotfiles repo
   ```bash
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/architeacher/.dotfiles/HEAD/scripts/download.sh | bash
   ```

2. Prerequisites
    We will use `make` for the installation to get help

   ```bash

   To create the `.env` file with variables that will be used in the installation, please run
   ```bash
